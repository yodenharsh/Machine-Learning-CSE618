# Machine Learning Lab 02

### Date - 02/08/23

## Objective

- Develop a program to demonstrate the statistical descriptions, histogram, box plot, scatter plots, data distribution, identifying missing values, data imputation, outliers of your dataset?

- For above dataset, apply any built in regression / classfier to observe the model learning capacity. Revise your split strategy of dataset and compare the outputs in terms of accuracy / error having different splitting creteria (hold out, k fold, stratified k fold, loocv etc), change parameters and also observe the improvements in learning capacity of your model?

- Do this for 1 pre-available dataset and 1 self-made synthetic datasets

## Dataset source

- The pre-available dataset was made available from kaggle. [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhil7280/student-performance-multiple-linear-regression)

## Personal Comments

- Learnt which kind of performance measures to use on linear regression and train test split combination
- Learnt how to obtain a Linear Regression model based on multiple independent variables
