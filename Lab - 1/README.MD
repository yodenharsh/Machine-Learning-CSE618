# Machine Learning Lab 01

## Objective

- Exploring and understanding 2 datasets of our choice
- Performing various pandas/numpy operations on those same datasets

## Dataset source

- All datasets in lab 1 were obtained from Kaggle

## Personal Comments

- Still figuring out how do you understand and explore datasets and therefore documents may not be up to a standard.
- Used mostly pandas operations as, for what I wanted to get, using numpy wasn't really necessary.
- Also used various visualization tools to understand dataset.
