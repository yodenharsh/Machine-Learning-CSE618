# Machine Learning Lab 03

### Date - 09/08/23

## Objective

- Write a python code to demonstrate the confusion matrix, accuracy, other metrics with plots in sklearn. You are allowed to use any tabular data set from kaggle.

- Write a python code to demonstrate the use of linear regression and metrics to compute error illustrating with plots. You can try to use dataset from kaggle like student performance data set or salary and experience dataset.

- Show the illustrations using the plots to demonstrate the probability distribution plots as per the dataset you consider?

## Dataset source

- The pre-available dataset was made available from kaggle. [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices)

## Personal Comments

- Learnt which kind of performance measures to use on Classification models
- Learnt how to plot various performance measures and probablity distribution graphs
